## User Feedback for Alexandria:

__Lauren says:__

>  “I like this app generally, and the speed at which books come up on my phone after I enter the ISBN is awesome. I’m frustrated that the scanning functionality isn’t implemented yet. That would speed up the whole process and make the app way more useful for me.”

__Josh says:__

>  “This app is terrible. They say you can scan books, but that functionality isn’t in the app yet. It also crashed on me when I tried to add the book my sister was reading on the flight to London.”

__Hsiao-Lu says:__

>  “The app could use some work. Sometimes when I add a book and don’t double-check the ISBN, it just disappears!”
