# Project Overview

You will productionize two apps, taking them from a functional state to a production-ready state. This will involve finding and handling error cases, adding accessibility features, allowing for localization, adding a widget, and adding a library.

# Why this Project?

Super Duo gives you an opportunity to diagnose problems in a pair of apps and also practice improving apps. These skills are vital to building apps users will love.

Diagnosing issues with existing apps is key to working on large apps or continuing projects in Android. Being aware of the common pitfalls in app design frees a developer to produce novel app experiences without making the same mistakes over and over.

# What Will I Learn?

In this project, you will:

* Diagnose existing issues with an app.
* Make an app accessible to sight-impaired users.
* Allow your app to be localized for distribution in other countries.
* Handle error cases in Android.
* Add a widget to your app experience.
* Leverage the functionality of a library in your app.


# How Will I Complete this Project?

You will improve two apps for this project:

__Alexandria__: A book list and barcode scanner app.

__Football Scores__ : An app that tracks current and future football matches (soccer, for students in the USA).

You can download the starting code for both apps in the Downloadables section. These apps are currently functional, and work in most cases for most users.

Your job will be to take the user feedback in the UX Review node, and implement changes that will make each app production ready.

All of the issues you need to address to meet specifications are hinted at in the UX Review. There are also a few optional ways in which the apps can be improved that are not mentioned in the UX Review.

# Supporting Courses

You should have the skills you need to complete this app after completing Developing Android Apps and Advanced Android App Development.

# Required Tasks

* Download a zip file of each of the two apps from the Downloadables section.
* Read the UX Review in the next node.
* Spend time exploring the current state of the apps, looking for ways they could be improved. Each app will need 2 or 3 improvements. Be sure to look specifically at issues called out in the UX Review.
* Execute the improvements!
* For Nanodegree students: Make a single GitHub repo with your code for both apps, and submit through the Nanodegree portal. See the Submission and Evaluation node for detailed instructions.
* For detailed information on how your project will be assessed, see the Rubric node.
